# Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis

**Summary**
This project analyzes telecom customer churn using Python. The data is cleaned by handling missing values, fixing blank entries, and converting variables into more readable categories to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory analysis uses visualizations to study churn patterns across attributes like senior citizenship, contract type, internet service, and payment methods. These steps help identify trends and risk factors.

The findings show that about a quarter of customers have churned. Senior citizens, short-tenure customers, those on month-to-month contracts, using fiber optic internet, paying by electronic checks, or lacking online security are more likely to leave, providing insights to guide retention strategies.
